# Rhapsody · Apple‑World — GitHub Pages starter

This repository is a **no‑build** static site ready for GitHub Pages.

## Two ways to publish

- **User/Org site** → create repo named `your-username.github.io` and push.
- **Project site** → enable Pages in Settings → set branch `main` and `/root`.

No Jekyll is required (we include a `.nojekyll` file).

## Customize

- Edit `index.html` sections (About/Research/Projects/Notes/Contact).
- Replace `assets/favicon.svg` with your logo.
- Tune colors in `assets/style.css` (brand/accent/highlight).

## Add notes/blog

Create a `/notes/` folder and add Markdown files. Link them in the **Notes** section.

## Typora + PDF

Author in Typora with your **Catalyst/Rhapsody** theme, export to HTML/PDF, and drop into this repo (e.g., `/notes/your-post.html`). Links will just work.
